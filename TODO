- Have a specific type for SMPP types with two values like 0 or 17
- We need to have a representation for DataTime values according to the spec
- Define helper constants for all parameters have an enumeration in the spec

- The spec says if ms_availability_status field is not set in alert_notification
  PDU, the ESME should regard the status as AVAILABLE. Should I go ahead and
  make this convenience available in this pure wire library or do this in a
  higher up library? favouring the higher-up library approach, but documenting
  this here so I do not forget this.

- I need to be sure that a broken PDU gets an appropriate response, this should
  be tested in a higher level library though, not in here

- Define type specifications for all functions that take protocol based
  constants to limit the legal values. For instance smpp34pdu:pack/3 should
  should define a command_status() type that defines all the command status
  macros, and there should be a command_id() type that defines all the valid
  command ids, etc

- you know... string is really octstring
